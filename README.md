## How to Build the Extension Automatically (Windows)

1. Make sure you have 7zip installed, as Microsoft built-in compression tools are often quite wonky, and the install.
2. Download this project by going to Code > Download ZIP, and unzipping the file into a folder once it's downloaded.
3. Locate the file `build.bat` in the uncompressed folder, and run it. Again, it will need 7zip installed on your system.
4. If it ran successfully, you will have two files called `Chromium.zip` and `Firefox.zip`, these are the extension files for Chromium and Firefox-based browsers, subsequently.

### Installing the extension in Firefox
1. Open your Firefox-based browser.
2. Paste `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` into your searchbar.
3. Press "Load Temporary Add-On..." and select `Firefox.zip`.
4. Go to YouTube and see if it worked!

### Installing the extension in Chrome / Chromium / Edge
1. UnZIP the `Chromium.zip` file somewhere convenient that you'll be able to find again.
2. In your Chromium-based browser, paste `edge://extensions/` in your search bar, this will take you to the extension page.
3. Turn on "Developer Mode." This will allow you to sideload extensions.
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the directory where you put the contents of `Chromium.zip`.
5. Go to YouTube and see if it worked!
