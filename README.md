- This extension was forked from **[MrBeastify YouTube](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube/tree/main)**.

## How to Build the Extension Automatically

1. If you are on Windows, make sure you have 7zip installed, as Microsoft built-in compression tools are often quite wonky, and the install. For macOS and Linux, 'zip' is usually pre-installed.
2. Download this project by going to Code > Download ZIP, and unzipping the file into a folder once it's downloaded.
3. Locate the files `build-Windows.bat` or `build-macOS-Linux.sh` in the uncompressed folder, and run the one for your operating system. For Windows users, just double-click the file to run it. For macOS users, you may need to run `chmod +x build-macOS-Linux.sh` in the terminal (while in the folder the script is located) before running the script to make it executable. You can then run it in the terminal by typing `./build-macOS-Linux.sh`.
4. If it ran successfully, you will have two files called `Chromium.zip` and `Firefox.zip`, these are the extension files for Chromium and Firefox-based browsers, subsequently.

### Installing the extension in Firefox
1. Open your Firefox-based browser.
2. Paste `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` into your searchbar.
3. Press "Load Temporary Add-On..." and select `Firefox.zip`.
4. Go to YouTube and see if it worked!

### Installing the extension in Chrome / Chromium / Edge
1. UnZIP the `Chromium.zip` file somewhere convenient that you'll be able to find again.
2. In your Chromium-based browser, paste `browser-name://extensions/` in your search bar, this will take you to the extension page (ex. MS Edge would be `edge://extensions/`, Chrome would be `chrome://extensions/`, Vivaldi would be `vivaldi://extensions/`, etc).
3. Turn on "Developer Mode." This will allow you to sideload extensions.
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the directory where you put the contents of `Chromium.zip`.
5. Go to YouTube and see if it worked!
